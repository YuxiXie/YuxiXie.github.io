<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> In an idealized New York City during the early '60s, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) is a charming socialite with a youthful zest for life who lives alone in a nearly bare apartment. She has such a flippant lifestyle that she won't even give her cat a name, because that would be too much of a commitment to a relationship. Maintaining a childlike innocence yet wearing the most perfect of designer clothes and accessories from Givenchy, she spends her time on expensive dates and at high-class parties. She escorts various wealthy men, yet fails to return their affections after they have given her gifts and money. Holly's carefree independence is changed when she meets her neighbor, aspiring writer Paul (George Peppard), who is suffering from writer's block while being kept by a wealthy woman (Patricia Neal). Just when Holly and Paul are developing their sweet romance, Doc (Buddy Ebsen) appears on the scene and complicates matters, revealing the truth about Holly's past. Breakfast at Tiffany's was nominated for several Academy awards, winning Best Score for Henry Mancini and Best Song for Johnny Mercer's classic tune "Moon River".<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> You can also refer to the thumbnail (for replaying: please refresh the page). <br/><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L_TvaJulWx0?start=80&end=84&version=3" scrolling="yes" frameborder="yes" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="900" height="600"></iframe> <br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> Breakfast at Tiffany's  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> The Only Chance at Real Happiness </strong> <code>Comedy</code><code>Drama</code><code>Romance</code><br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> After Holly (Audrey Hepburn) tosses the cat out in the rain, Fred (George Peppard) stops the taxi and is brutally honest with her before leaving.<br/><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[Tasks]</font></strong> 2 reasoning task(s) in total <br/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 1 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkGreen>ABDUCTIVE</font> </li>  <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothesis]</font></strong> <code>(observed result)</code> The man speak to the woman calmly in the standing outside the cab.
