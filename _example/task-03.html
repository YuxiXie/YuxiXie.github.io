<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> Novelist William Peter Blatty based his best-seller on the last known Catholic-sanctioned exorcism in the United States. Blatty transformed the little boy in the 1949 incident into a little girl named Regan, played by 14-year-old Linda Blair. Suddenly prone to fits and bizarre behavior, Regan proves quite a handful for her actress-mother, Chris MacNeil (played by Ellen Burstyn, although Blatty reportedly based the character on his next-door neighbor Shirley MacLaine). When Regan gets completely out of hand, Chris calls in young priest Father Karras (Jason Miller), who becomes convinced that the girl is possessed by the Devil and that they must call in an exorcist: namely, Father Merrin (Max von Sydow). His foe proves to be no run-of-the-mill demon, and both the priest and the girl suffer numerous horrors during their struggles. The Exorcist received a theatrical rerelease in 2000, in a special edition that added 11 minutes of footage trimmed from the film's original release and digitally enhanced Chris Newman's Oscar-winning sound work.<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> You can also refer to the thumbnail (for replaying: please refresh the page). <br/><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCGGXaMANys?start=0&end=4&version=3" scrolling="yes" frameborder="yes" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="900" height="600"></iframe> <br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> The Exorcist  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> What's Wrong With Her? </strong> <code>Horror</code><br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> Chris (Ellen Burstyn) tries to yell some sense into the doctors that cannot look past their own knowledge to find a solution.<br/><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[Tasks]</font></strong> 1 reasoning task(s) in total <br/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 1 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkRed>PREDICTION</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> the men exit the bedroom inside the house </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what will happen then ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>effect</code><font size="4"> the women stare the man with hope in the second floor</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A2</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>reaction</code><font size="4"> the man look the women like they have bad news inside the house</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr></p>
