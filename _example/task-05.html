<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> Picking up precisely where its hit predecessor left off, Sony Pictures Animation's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 finds Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader) invited to join the Live Corp Company, and use his gift for invention for the good of mankind. Just as young Flint prepares to go to work for his hero Chester V (voice of Will Forte), however, the young genius learns that his water-to-food machine is not only still functional, but it's also started cross-breeding animals with food. Now, in order to prevent a growing army of "foodimals" from escaping isolation on an island and wreaking havoc on the mainland, Flint and his loyal group of friends will have to do battle with such delicious, but deadly, hybrids as the ferocious tacodiles, slithering apple pie-thons, and vine-swinging shrimpanzees. Saving the world from these rampaging monstrosities won't be easy, but if anyone is up to the task, it's Flint and company. Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn takes the reins for this sequel also featuring vocal contributions by Anna Faris, James Caan, Kristen Schaal, Terry Crews, Andy Samberg, Neil Patrick Harris, and Benjamin Bratt.<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> You can also refer to the thumbnail (for replaying: please refresh the page). <br/><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3PBo1ef-18Y?start=130&end=134&version=3" scrolling="yes" frameborder="yes" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="900" height="600"></iframe> <br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> Living Food Scene </strong> <br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> Flint (Bill Hader) and the gang discover an island of living food animals.<br/><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[Tasks]</font></strong> 1 reasoning task(s) in total <br/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 1 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkGreen>ABDUCTIVE</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> the man with the scoop take the strawberry towards the waters sharply </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what has possibly happened ealier ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>condition</code><font size="4"> the people in the boat sail forward on the waters</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr></p>
