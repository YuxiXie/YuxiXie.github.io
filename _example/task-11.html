<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> Filmmaking siblings Joel Coen and Ethan Coen both embraced and poked satirical fun at their Minnesotan roots with this comedy-drama-thriller that earned seven Oscar nominations, winning for Best Actress and Best Original Screenplay. Frances McDormand stars as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief whose affable, folksy demeanor masks a whip-smart mind. When a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper, Marge begins piecing together a case involving a pair of dopey would-be kidnappers, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Bergman stock player Peter Stormare). They've been hired by Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a car salesman under the thumb of his wealthy, overbearing boss and father-in-law, Wade (Harve Presnell). Jerry's raised some money illegally through a petty scam he's run on General Motors and he's about to get caught. When Wade sours a business deal that could save his son-in-law's hide, the desperate Jerry hires Carl and Gaear to kidnap his wife and hold her for ransom. Things go predictably wrong and a series of murders occur, with Marge, waddling along behind her enormous belly and ever-hungering for an all-you-can-eat buffet, hot on the trail of the killers. Although the credits for Fargo state that the film is loosely based on real events, the story is entirely fictional, the claim being just an ironic jibe on the part of the Coens.<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> You can also refer to the thumbnail (for replaying: please refresh the page). <br/><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kPHbIyDTPHU?start=35&end=39&version=3" scrolling="yes" frameborder="yes" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="900" height="600"></iframe> <br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> Fargo  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> Morning Sickness Scene </strong> <code>Crime</code><code>Drama</code><code>Thriller</code><br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) investigates the murder of three people while dealing with morning sickness.<br/><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[Tasks]</font></strong> 2 reasoning task(s) in total <br/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 1 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkGreen>ABDUCTIVE</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> the police officer wearing a jacket grab the car door while kneeling down </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what may the police officer wearing a jacket have done or been doing ealier ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>condition</code><font size="4"> the police officer wearing a jacket kneel outside in the snow</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr><br/><hr/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 2 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkRed>PREDICTION</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> the police officer wearing a jacket kneel outside in the snow </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what may the police officer wearing a jacket do right after the hypothetical event ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>temporal</code><font size="4"> the police officer wearing a jacket grab the car door while kneeling down</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A2</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>temporal</code><font size="4"> the police officer wearing a jacket look inside the car while kneeling down in the outside in the snow</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr></p>
