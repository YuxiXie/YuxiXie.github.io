<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai (1954) is westernized as The Magnificent Seven. Yul Brynner plays Chris, a mercenary hired to protect a Mexican farming village from its annual invasion by bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach). As Elmer Bernstein's unforgettable theme music (later immortalized as the "Marlboro Man" leitmotif) blasts away in the background, Chris rounds up six fellow soldiers of fortune to help him form a united front against the bandits. The remaining "magnificent six" are played by Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, Horst Buchholz, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn, and (the one that everybody forgets) Brad Dexter. Though jam-packed with action, William Roberts's screenplay pauses long enough to flesh out each of its characters, allowing the audience to pick their own favorites. The Magnificent Seven was followed by three sequels, not to mention dozens of imitations.<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> You can also refer to the thumbnail (for replaying: please refresh the page). <br/><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtxPupFohQA?start=65&end=69&version=3" scrolling="yes" frameborder="yes" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="600" height="400"></iframe> <br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> The Magnificent Seven  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> Village Shootout </strong> <code>Action</code><code>Adventure</code><code>Western</code><br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> Chris (Yul Brynner) and the other six hired guns face off against Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his men.<br/><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[Tasks]</font></strong> 1 reasoning task(s) in total <br/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 1 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkGreen>ABDUCTIVE</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> the man in white clothes with a rifle target the group of horseback riders with a rifle by a village </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what has the group of horseback riders possibly done or been doing previously ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>cause</code><font size="4"> the group of horseback riders retreat by a village</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr></p>
