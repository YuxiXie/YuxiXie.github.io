<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> Alfie  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> A Father's Voice </strong> <code>Comedy</code><code>Drama</code><br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> Alfie (Michael Caine) gives some parental advise to Gilda (Julia Foster), and talks about his relationship with his son.<br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> Michael Caine's first starring role was a foray into dramatic irony, scripted by Bill Naughton from his novel and play. Alfie (Caine) is a charming, rogueish Cockney who cannot get his fill of women. He uses them without shame or malice, jumping from one promiscuous female's bed to another without much thought or feeling. Of course, Alfie's not as carefree as he would have the audience -- to whom he often speaks directly -- think: he treats his pregnant, common-law wife, Gilda (Julia Foster), quite shabbily, and has an affair with a married woman (Vivien Merchant) that leaves her pregnant, for which Alfie arranges an abortion. In the end, Alfie never finds lasting meaning or pleasure but remains an unrepentant, if low-class, Don Juan. Caine was Oscar-nominated for his performance.<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> Please refresh the page for replaying. <br/><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AF9cqjNt9uc?start=60&end=64&version=3" scrolling="yes" frameborder="yes" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="600" height="400"></iframe> <br/><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[Tasks]</font></strong> 2 reasoning task(s) in total <br/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 1 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkGreen>ABDUCTIVE</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> the man in grey shirt lower the child to the ground playfully in a park </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what may the man in grey shirt have done or been doing in the interval ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>cause</code><font size="4"> the man in grey shirt spin a child while looking upwards in a park</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr><br/><hr/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 2 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkRed>PREDICTION</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> the man in grey shirt spin a child while looking upwards in a park </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what may the man in grey shirt do later ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>effect</code><font size="4"> the man in grey shirt lower the child to the ground playfully in a park</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr></p>
