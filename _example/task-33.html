<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> Krull  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> A Changeling </strong> <code>Action</code><code>Adventure</code><code>Fantasy</code><br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> The fellowship is deceived by the Seer, who turns out to be a changeling sent by The Beast.<br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> Meant to be a whimsical sword-and-sorcery film about a prince out to save his princess from the jaws of the Beast, Krull has enough scenes borrowed from blockbuster predecessors (Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Robin Hood, Star Wars) and is gentle enough to be rather derivative, ordinary fare. Prince Colwyn (Ken Marshall) has inherited a kingdom under siege by the evil Beast, and not only has to rid the land of the monster, but he has to rescue his bride Lyssa (Lysette Anthony) from the Beast's clutches as well. In his magical land, horses can sometimes fly, medieval castles can harbor weapons that light up, and before he can defeat the Beast, the prince has to get his hands on the glaive (French for "double-edged sword"), a razor-sharp, magical weapon capable of killing the monster. One of the more notable aspects of Krull is that a 30-year old Liam Neeson plays the bit part of Kegan, in only his third full-length feature film.<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> Please refresh the page for replaying. <br/><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDdsxJLhp-E?start=5&end=9&version=3" scrolling="yes" frameborder="yes" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="600" height="400"></iframe> <br/><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[Tasks]</font></strong> 1 reasoning task(s) in total <br/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 1 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkGreen>ABDUCTIVE</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> crash the man dressed in brown through the dead saplings in the brook in the forest </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what might have happened in the interval ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>temporal</code><font size="4"> the man dressed in black turn his head to see upstream in the brook in the forest</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A2</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>temporal</code><font size="4"> the man dressed in black hike towards the brook</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr></p>
