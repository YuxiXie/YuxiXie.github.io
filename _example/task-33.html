<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel star in director Marc Webb's wry, nonlinear romantic comedy about a man who falls head over heels for a woman who doesn't believe in love. Tom (Gordon-Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary, Summer (Deschanel), Tom discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love the Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte. Before long Tom is smitten. All he can think about is Summer. Tom believes deeply in the concept of soul mates, and he's finally found his. Unfortunately for Tom, Summer sees true love as the stuff of fairy tales, and isn't looking for romance. Undaunted and undeterred by his breezy lover's casual stance on relationships, Tom summons all of his might and courage to pursue Summer and convince her that their love is real.<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> You can also refer to the thumbnail (for replaying: please refresh the page). <br/><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARoB1nWPsxo?start=35&end=39&version=3" scrolling="yes" frameborder="yes" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="900" height="600"></iframe> <br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> (500) Days of Summer  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> Playing House </strong> <code>Comedy</code><code>Drama</code><code>Romance</code><br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel) play husband and wife at a home furnishing store.<br/><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[Tasks]</font></strong> 4 reasoning task(s) in total <br/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 1 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkGreen>ABDUCTIVE</font> </li>  <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothesis]</font></strong> <code>(observed result)</code> The man in brown jacket act pretends to eat dinner in the man in brown jacket pretends he is about the eat his imaginary dinner. </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">What have the woman in dress done or been doing previously?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><font size="4">The woman in dress open the oven so she can look into it curiously in the woman in dress opens the oven to check it out and grab and imaginary dinner.</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr><br/><hr/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 2 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkRed>ABDUCTIVE_V</font> </li>  <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothesis]</font></strong> <code>(observed result)</code> The woman in dress open the oven so she can look into it curiously in the woman in dress opens the oven to check it out and grab and imaginary dinner.
