<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> Defending Your Life  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> How Did You Die? Scene </strong> <code>Comedy</code><code>Drama</code><code>Fantasy</code><br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> Daniel (Albert Brooks) and Julia (Meryl Streep) joke about how they died during their mini-golf date.<br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> Albert Brooks wrote, directed, and stars in this philosophical comedy about a man having a hard time making a case for himself in the afterlife. When advertising executive Daniel Miller (Albert Brooks) finds himself in a fatal car crash minutes after taking delivery on a new BMW, he's whisked away to Judgment City, where the recently dead are put on a sort of trial to decide their fate. If in your time on Earth you were able to face your fears and learn from your mistakes, you get to move on to a life in a better world. However, if you didn't, you have to go back to Earth and try again. As he spends the next several days watching various episodes from his life, Daniel gets the impression he doesn't stand much of a chance of moving on -- and his representative, Bob Diamond (Rip Torn), seems to have little confidence in his case. In the meantime, he frequents Judgment City's many restaurants (where the food is delicious and you can eat all you want without gaining an ounce), pays a visit to the Past Life Pavilion, and meets Julia (Meryl Streep), who seems so kind, sweet, and noble that her advancement is practically assured. Daniel and Julia fall in love, but what's going to happen if they don't end up in the same place? Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep make a witty and engaging romantic team in Defending Your Life, and Shirley MacLaine appears in a highly appropriate cameo.<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> You can also refer to the thumbnail.
