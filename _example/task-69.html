<p><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Movie]</font> Greystoke: Legend of Tarzan  <font color=DodgerBlue>[Clip]</font> Jungle Man </strong> <code>Adventure</code><code>Drama</code><br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Desc]</font></strong> Jane (Andie MacDowell) turns down Esker's (James Fox) marriage proposal and Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) makes things worse by protecting a friend.<br/><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[Background]</font></strong> Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes is a reverent retelling of the Edgar Rice Burroughs original, with a 1980s-sensibilities slant. Shipwrecked on the coast of Africa, Lord Jack Clayton (Paul Geoffrey) and his pregnant wife Lady Alice (Cheryl Campbell) attempt to survive in the hostile environment, but both die shortly after the birth of their son John. Abandoned in the wilderness, the orphaned John is adopted by a family of rather highly evolved apes, and raised as one of their own. Years later, John-now known as Tarzan, and now played by Christopher Lambert-comes across a party of white hunters. Rescuing one of the intruders, Belgian Captain Phillipe D'Arnot (Ian Holm) from a horrible death , Tarzan is taught to speak English by the grateful D'Arnot. Coming across the remains and possessions of Tarzan's parents, D'Arnot discovers that the Lord of the Jungle is actually the Earl of Greystoke. Brought back to England, Tarzan is introduced to society, where his crude, apelike manners offend everyone--except the likeable (and painfully senile) 6th Lord of Greystoke (Ralph Richardson, in his final film role) and Greystoke's American ward, Jane Porter (Andie McDowell, whose Southern-fried voice is dubbed by Glenn Close). Disturbed at the notion of Tarzan's inheriting Greystoke manner, his more greedy relatives begin plotting against him. But it is Tarzan himself who decides that he cannot adapt himself to England-especially after a painful reunion with his ape foster father, imprisoned in a science-lab cage.<br/><strong><font color=YellowGreen>[Premise]</font></strong> Please refresh the page for replaying. <br/><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tsk9gCcchg8?start=90&end=94&version=3" scrolling="yes" frameborder="yes" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="450" height="300"></iframe> <br/><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[Tasks]</font></strong> 2 reasoning task(s) in total <br/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 1 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkGreen>ABDUCTIVE</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> the man in black jacket hit the small man towards whip repeatedly </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what has possibly happened ealier ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>temporal</code><font size="4"> the man with long hair peek down in the up on top of building</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr><br/><hr/><br/><tr> <strong><font size="4"> task 2 </font></strong><li><strong>[task type]</strong> <font color=DarkGreen>ABDUCTIVE</font> </li> <li><strong><font color=DodgerBlue>[hypothese]</font></strong> <code>(observation 2)</code> the man in black jacket hit the small man towards whip repeatedly </li> <li><strong><font color=BlueViolet>[question-answers]</font></strong><br/> <table><tr><td width="30" bgcolor=LightPink><strong><font size="4">Q</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LightPink><font size="4">what might the man in black jacket have done or been doing in the interval ?</font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><strong><font size="4">A1</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=LemonChiffon><code>temporal</code><font size="4"> the man in black jacket grab the whip pushing small man against car</font></td></tr></table> </li> </tr></p>
