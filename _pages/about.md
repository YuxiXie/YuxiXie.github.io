My name is Yuxi /'jʊ'ʃiː/. I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/). 

Prior to that, I worked with [Prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/) and received B.S. in Data Science and Big Data Technology from the [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).

My primary research focus is on Multimodal and Language Model Reasoning. I am working on developing training and inference-time algorithms to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large foundation models, including both multimodal and language models. My research will facilitate deeper understanding of model interpretability and reliability, improving their reasoning abilities to better align with human preferences. 
I've also been interested in Natural Language Generation, especially about generating deep questions which require complex reasoning on textual or multimodal data.

My name written in Chinese is 谢雨汐.
