My name is Yuxi /'jʊ'ʃiː/. I am a final-year Ph.D. student in [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/). 

I am currently visiting the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu/), [University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)](https://www.ucsb.edu/) in AY 2024/2025, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. William Yang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/).

<b><font color="#228B22" size=5>I am actively seeking full-time industry positions. Please feel free to email me if you're interested!</font></b>

Prior to that, I worked with [Prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/) and received B.S. in Data Science and Big Data Technology from the [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).

My primary research focus is on Multimodal and Language Model Reasoning. 
I am working on developing training and inference-time algorithms to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large foundation models, including both multimodal and language models. 
I've also been interested in Natural Language Generation, especially about generating deep questions that require complex reasoning on textual or multimodal data.

My name written in Chinese is 谢雨汐.
