            <strong><font color=Red>[Part Two] Judge Existing Inference </font></strong> (each inference is provided in a form of QA pair) <br/>
            Below are 4 inferences to judge: <br/>

                <tr><td><code>predictive</code> What is going to happen to the girl instantly? </td></tr>
                <tr><td>The girl shows the book to the man after the fence. </td></tr>

            For each inference, judge by answering below questions: <br/>
            <table>
                <tr><td><strong>[Q1]</strong> <code>feasible</code> Is the question answerable or can we provide a plausible answer to it? </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>[Q2]</strong> <code>not unexpected</code> Is the given answer too unexpected to predict? </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>[Q3]</strong> <code>interesting</code> Is the provided answer so general that it is not that specific given the premise and observation? </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>[Q4]</strong> <code>multimodal</code> Does the question require information from both premise and observation to answer? </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>[Q5]</strong> <code>commonsense</code> Does the question relate to any of the knowledge you use to answer the queries in Part One? </td></tr>

        <li>
            <strong><font color=Red>[Part Three] Inference Generation </font></strong> Based on the knowledge you use to answer the queries in Part One, write an answer to the questions below. <br/>
            <strong>PS</strong>: make sure the question requires info from both premise and observation to answer.
            <table>
                <tr><td><strong>[Q1]</strong> <code>abductive</code> What has happened to the girl in between the observation & premise? </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>[Q2]</strong> <code>predictive</code> What is going to happen to the girl instantly after the observation? </td></tr>
