Henry Thomas plays Elliott, a young boy living with his single mother (Dee Wallace), his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and his younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Elliott often seems lonely and out of sorts, lost in his own world. One day, while looking for something in the back yard, he senses something mysterious in the woods watching him. And he's right: an alien spacecraft on a scientific mission mistakenly left behind an aging botanist who isn't sure how to get home. Eventually Elliott puts his fears aside and makes contact with the \"little squashy guy,\" perhaps the least threatening alien invader ever to hit a movie screen. As Elliott tries to keep the alien under wraps and help him figure out a way to get home, he discovers that the creature can communicate with him telepathically. Soon they begin to learn from each other, and Elliott becomes braver and less threatened by life. E.T. rigs up a communication device from junk he finds around the house, but no one knows if he'll be rescued before a group of government scientists gets hold of him.

In this case, Edwards cast Roberto Benigni as Jacques Gambrelli, a hopelessly inept French policeman who turns out the be the illegitimate son of Inspector Clouseau. Gambrelli becomes involved with the investigation of a kidnapping involving the beautiful Princess Yasmin (Debrah Farentino) literally by accident, when he crashes into a car driven by Police Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom). Gambrelli soon becomes smitten with Yasmin, while the investigation suggests that the kidnapping was set up by her mother, the Queen (Shabana Azmi), and her lover, General Jaffar (Aharon Ipale). Claudia Cardinale who played a different character in the original Pink Panther returns, while Burt Kwouk returns as the violent Korean manservant Cato. Roberto Benigni's Gambrelli proved no more successful at the box office than Ted Wass's Clouseau-like Clifton Sleigh in The Curse of the Pink Panther (1983), though after his multiple-Oscar winning success with 1998's La Vita e Bella, Roberto's probably gotten over it.", "task": {"count": 3, "tasks": [{"type": "abductive", "premise_v": [0, 4], "result_l": "The police officer talk towards the people close to the car funnily.", "hypothesis": ["Stand the police officer towards the close to the tree happily."], "question": "What has possibly happened to the the police officer before?"}, {"type": "abductive_v", "premise_v": [0, 2], "result_l": "Stand the police officer towards the close to the tree happily.

Of course no magnate in his right mind would reject the prospect of tracking down the most mythical treasure on the planet, and now as the hapless Tess is forced on yet another wild goose chase, her husband's former mentor Moe Fitch (Ray Winstone) and a greedy local gangster (Kevin Hart) up the stakes by joining in on the race.", "task": {"count": 3, "tasks": [{"type": "abductive", "premise_v": [0, 4], "result_l": "The blond woman threaten in a field.", "hypothesis": ["Fall the man in white shirt from on the ground into a hole quickly in a field."], "question": "What has possibly happened to the man in white shirt before?"}, {"type": "abductive_v", "premise_v": [0, 2], "result_l": "Fall the man in white shirt from on the ground into a hole quickly in a field.

Disgusted with the inability of the police to bring Vendice to justice, Philippa takes the law into her own hands, planting a bomb which is intended to kill the dealer.

Philippa is arrested and brought before the police for questioning, not knowing that the interrogating officer in charge of the case, Pini (Mattia Sbragia), is one of Vendice's secret business associates. More comfortable with English than Italian, Philippa requests a translator, and multilingual officer Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi) is brought in to serve as interpreter. Filippo finds himself falling in love with Philippa, and with his help she's able to escape and go into hiding; however, despite her deep regrets about the loss of four lives in the bombing, she is still bound and determined to see Vendice dead.", "task": {"count": 3, "tasks": [{"type": "abductive", "premise_v": [0, 4], "result_l": "The man in blue shirt jog down an alley in an alley.", "hypothesis": ["The girl in black pants remove a purple hoodie towards themselves in an alley."], "question": "What have the girl in black pants done or been doing previously?"}, {"type": "abductive_v", "premise_v": [0, 2], "result_l": "The girl in black pants remove a purple hoodie towards themselves in an alley.
