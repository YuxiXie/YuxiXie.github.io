Interweaving multiple storylines from the series' history, this violent crime noir paints the picture of the ultimate town without pity through the eyes of its roughest characters. There's the street thug Marv (Mickey Rourke), whose desperate quest to find the killer of a prostitute named Goldie (Jaime King) will lead him to the foulest edges of town. Inhabiting many of those areas is Dwight (Clive Owen), a photographer in league with the sordid ladies of Sin City, headed by Gail (Rosario Dawson), who opens up a mess of trouble after tangling with a corrupt cop by the name of Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). Finally, there's Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ex-cop with a heart problem who's hell-bent on protecting a stripper named Nancy (Jessica Alba). Featuring a who's who supporting cast that includes Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki, and Nick Stahl, Sin City promises to be one of the most direct translations from page to screen of a comic series, with shots and dialogue adapted straight from the original comic's panels. Rodriguez quit the Director's Guild when they refused to let Frank Miller co-direct the film, a deal hashed out after the two collaborators developed and shot the opening scene utilizing a green-screen process to harness the stark, black-and-white look of the books as a litmus test for the rest of the production. Quentin Tarantino was brought in and reportedly paid one dollar to direct an extended scene between Del Toro and Owen that amounts to one issue of The Big Fat Kill miniseries.", "task": {"count": 2, "tasks": [{"label": "abductive", "premise": ["v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000001", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000002", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000003", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000004", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000005", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000006", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000007", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000008"], "hypothese": "the man in the dark jacket observe the woman dancing on stage inside a club", "question": "what may have happened in the interval ?", "answers": [{"ans": "the woman with the rope dance towards none seductively", "rel": "trigger"}, {"ans": "the woman with the rope dance towards none seductively", "rel": "temporal"}]}, {"label": "prediction", "premise": ["v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000001", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000002", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000003", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000004", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000005", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000006", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000007", "v_KrDck8ocFu0_seg_25_35_000008"], "hypothese": "the woman with the rope dance towards none seductively", "question": "what is going to happen immediately after the hypothetical event ?", "answers": [{"ans": "the man in the dark jacket observe the woman dancing on stage inside a club", "rel": "reaction"}]}]}}

June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is preparing to board a flight back home for her sister's wedding when she literally bumps into Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) in the middle of a busy airport. A few minutes later, they're making small talk on the plane when June excuses herself to the bathroom, and all hell breaks loose in the fuselage. By the time June emerges Roy has killed everybody on board, including the pilots. After crash-landing the plane in a darkened cornfield, Roy tells June that she should expect a visit from government agents, but warns her that by cooperating with them she risks almost certain death. The following day, Roy's prediction comes true when June is confronted by an imposing gang of government spooks who come under heavy fire while bombarding her with questions about her mysterious traveling companion. Suddenly, Roy is back, and he's once again whisking June away to safety. But what do the agents want, and why do they insist that Roy is the one to be feared, and not them? Before long the girl who never traveled far from home is off on a wild adventure that will take her from the tropics to Austria, France, and Spain. Somewhere amidst all of the confusion and gunfire, June begins to forge a bond with Roy. Unfortunately, it's never quite clear whether her unpredictable protector is one of the good guys or the bad guys, and by the time Roy reveals that he's attempting to protect a valuable new energy source, there's no time for questions.

However, with the help of Father Cavanaugh (Robert Prosky), a sympathetic priest, Rudy is admitted to nearby Holy Cross, and in his junior year manages to squeak into Notre Dame as a transfer student. Rudy works as an assistant to the football stadium's groundskeeper, Fortune (Charles S. Dutton), to pay his tuition (often sleeping in Fortune's office since he can't afford a room), studies diligently, and appears at tryouts for the football team. Rudy is made a member of the practice team, which means he's little more than a human tackling dummy, but Coach Ara Parseghian (Jason Miller) is impressed with Rudy's devotion and determination, and pledges that he'll allow him to dress for one game before he graduates, so his name can be recorded as an official member of the team.

After the defense industry firm Globotech takes over a small toy company, Heartland Play Systems' CEO Gil Mars (Denis Leary) gives the green light to develop a new line of action figures, requesting an upgrade to more realistic figures from Heartland toy designers Larry Benson (Jay Mohr) and fumbling Irwin Wayfair (David Cross). Mars wants toys that act like the ones in TV commercials. The results are fierce fighting figures, the Commando Elite, programmed to seek out and destroy the kindly alien-like Gorgonites. In an effort to make the toys as natural as possible, Benson inserts Globotech's most powerful military computer chips. Meanwhile, in quiet Winslow Corners, Ohio, toy-store owner Stuart Abernathy (Kevin Dunn) and his 15-year-old son Alan (Gregory Smith) are stuck in a failing business, so when Heartland truckdriver Joe (Dick Miller) stops by with the Commando and Gorgonite toys, Alan is convinced they will be hot sellers, commenting, \"Maybe this store will finally make a little money.\" With blistering blows to their blister packs, the Commandos burst out, receive orders from their leader Chip Hazard (voice of Tommy Lee Jones) and ready for an all-out assault on the Gorgonites. When the Gorgonite leader Archer (voice of Frank Langella) begins communicating with Alan, it causes the Commandos to perceive humans as another enemy, simply by their association with the \"Gorgonite scum,\" so an attack on the Abernathy house begins. Unfortunately, the Gorgonites can offer only limited assistance, since they have been programmed to lose. The film combines animatronics, puppetry, and computer animation. The Commando Elite voices include surviving actors from Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen (1967), while the Gorgonite voices reunited several This Is Spinal Tap (1983) cast members.

While Phillips' team follow his orders to hide until they hear him give the safe word, the captain and a few essential crew members remain on the bridge as the heavily armed pirates make their way up to seize control of the ship. But the interlopers soon discover something that sends them into a furious rage: After effectively shutting down the ship, Phillips explains that the Maersk had malfunctioned when the crew pushed it too hard in an attempt to evade the attackers. In order to appease their leader, the ruthless Muse (Barkhad Abdi), Phillips offers them the $30,000 that's been locked in the ship safe. But that isn't enough, and Muse demands that Phillips help him search every corner of the ship to root out the terrified crew. When that plan fails, the pirates agree to take the cash from the safe and flee in the Maersk's lifeboat. At the last minute, however, they kidnap Phillips in the hope of supplementing their take with a sizable ransom -- a decision that leads to a tense standoff with the U.S. Navy, who would sooner see the lifeboat sunk with Phillips inside than allow it to reach Somalia.", "task": {"count": 2, "tasks": [{"label": "abductive", "premise": ["v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000001", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000002", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000003", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000004", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000005", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000006", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000007", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000008"], "hypothese": "stand the crew towards engine room gathered together quietly", "question": "what might the crew have done or been doing before ?", "answers": [{"ans": "the crew listen the captain over the speaker inside the ship", "rel": "trigger"}]}, {"label": "prediction", "premise": ["v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000001", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000002", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000003", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000004", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000005", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000006", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000007", "v_j21idqW08wU_seg_120_130_000008"], "hypothese": "the crew listen the captain over the speaker inside the ship", "question": "what will happen to the crew afterwards ?", "answers": [{"ans": "stand the crew towards engine room gathered together quietly", "rel": "reaction"}]}]}}

Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart, his son is a junkie, and his health is failing, which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia (and killing 26 people) with little to show for it. But in Donnie, Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime; however, the longer he plays the role of the gangster, the more Joe Pistone finds himself becoming Donnie Brasco in his increasingly rare off hours; it drives a wedge between himself and his wife (Anne Heche) and children, and Joe realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family.
